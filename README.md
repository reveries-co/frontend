 # Reveries Methodology

## Intro 

Yep Pedro, all running on my laptop. 

In January 2018, I had the chance to go to Davos to attend the World Economic Forum. I was there the previous year, so I knew what I was in for: a ton of though-provoking discussions, new trends and late night conversations about our societies current challenges. In one of the sessions I was in, the topic was the Future of Work. I can't think of a session where I paid more attention, I don't think my mind drifted one single second. I left the session, and entrusted my notes to carry those lessons for eternity. Here are the actual notes:

>What we need are social trampolines not social safety nets. Stephane Kasriel, upwork
>Singapore has a reskilling contribution to social security, France has copied it. Alain dehaze, adecco
>China has released a textbook in AI and that is part of the compulsory children curriculum. Amy Webb, future today Institute
>Skills passport - you have a growth path (like learning@google) in a company, when you leave you take it with you and can be used on a new company.

I wrote on a Google Docs, it's still there and frankly, will never leave it. 

How many workshops, podcasts, conversations, books have turned on a lightbulb in your head, you became overly excited for a couple of seconds, and moved on? 

There is no limitation on the amount of fantastic content out there - but we dearly need help in processing and - specially - to make sense of it. 

Reveries is not a note taking methodology. It's a *thinking methodology*. 

It's heavily inspired by the Zettelkasten methodology, although it simplifies it some areas and makes the methodology digitally native. 

## Principles
Why do you have so many random cryptic notes in several different places? Why do they seem highly relevant at the time, but you end up never looking at them again? 

There are three reasons for it:

1. It's a citation, not a translation: For your brain to weave that idea permanently, you can't just make a highlight on a book or take a citation. You need to answer the question - *"Why is this relevant for me?" *That answer is your note, not the quote.
2. It lacks context: When you write it, you do it assuming you will forever remember why you wrote it. Turns out, we never do. So if you want that note to be permanent, you need to actually write it as if you were explaining it to someone else without context, not to your present self.
3. It's not linked to anything: Your notes should follow the way your brain thinks, and that is in connections. You need to connect notes to one another, for *every* single note.

## Fleeting and Permanent Notes

Here's the good news - there aren't a ton of concepts to learn. The main ones are the two types of notes, fleeting and permanent. 

1. Fleeting Notes
Fleeting notes are notes that you create on the go, that don't follow the Principles above. You're reading a book, thinking about work at the gym, or watching a movie, a lightbulb turns on your brain, and you create a note as quickly as possible in any format (that includes voice notes if that's your thing). It's all good as long as you answer the question "why did I find this insightful? Why is it relevant?" Do **not** write the citation that triggered the insight, but your translation of it. 

2. Permanent Notes
Every day or so, you should convert Fleeting notes to permanent notes. The structure of the permanent notes is the following:
		
		**Name:** Try to give it a unique and rememberable name. You'll be linking this note to others, so your job will be easier if you know what's in it.
		**Tags:** Feel free to add tags, as long as you don't add more than two. I pick a Macro-tag and sometimes a Micro-tag.
		**Links:** This is the most important aspect of the Permanent note and what makes it permanent - here, you should pick the note that most connects with this one. Feel free to add more than one, sometimes notes have very different paths that cross the most distinct topics.
		**	Note: **This should be your fleeting note, rewritten, with more context and without any typos. Remember, write as if you were writing to someone else.
		**Source (Optional):** If needed, you can add the source that triggered this insight. In the future 

## Best practices

* Don't take more than two days to convert fleeting notes. You'll forget the context, and linking will be much harder.

 * Resist the temptation not to write things in your own words. It's literally the reason why this process is not a repository of notes but your thinking in motion. If needed, write a post it and put it in your screen "Why is this relevant to me? Why is this insightful?"

* Tags are useful to a point, but they are not the cornerstone of the methodology, just a grouping functionality that makes searching easier.

* Open your Reveries randomly, and browse through the notes freely. You'll be surprised by the paths that your thoughts take. 

* Feel free to edit them over time - you'll have more context, more links, so your permanent notes can and should evolve over time!

## Conclusion & Next Steps

Notes are fragile - the more you have, the less useful they are. With Reveries, the more notes you have, the more links there are, the more powerful each note becomes. That's why it's not a repository of notes that you never re-read, but a fundamental tool to help you think and process information. 

Currently, Obsidian provides the necessary capabilities to do all of this. I use Google Keep for my fleeting notes, and convert them to permanent on my laptop. 

Ready to get started? It doesn't have to be daunting - start with some lightbulb that you can remember that triggered in the last few days, or some note (a proto-fleeting note!) that you took. When you start making the first links, you'll understand the power of your second brain at work.
